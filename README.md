# Overview

Using ARCGIS, I created a interactive map that you can input City and State code to find real-time real estate listings.

I wanted to write something that would allow me to find listings of houses and land in certain areas of the USA that would be fast and light.

# Development Environment

Using VSCode and live server I was able to create an interactive map and edit the code in real time, watching the changes happen as soon as I have made them.

Hosting in HTML and running dynamic code in JavaScript I was able to import data from RapidAPI and ARCGIS to create a live interactive map.
